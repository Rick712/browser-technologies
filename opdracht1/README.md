### Opdracht 1.2 - Fork your OBA

## 1. Images
The website contains no images (yet). 

## 2. Custom fonts
The website does use a custom font. When there is a slow network connection, the site automaticly switches to the fallback font. There is no icon font.

## 3. Disable Javascript
The complete website relies on Javascript. The two query calls are done with JS. At this point, there is no feedback for the user if the JS is disabled, so that's kinda bad.

## 4. Colour
The website is completely in black and white tones. The contrast between the elements is enough to tell the difference between them, even for colour-blind people. 

## 5. High speed internet
The website is not really optimised for low speed internet, but it's not that bad. It takes around 6 seconds for the website to be interactive, and 8 seconds to fully load. The query doesn't take much time either. When the page is interactive, the call is executed and the results are placed on the website

## 6. Cookies
The website doesn't use cookies. 

## 7. Localstorage
The website doesn't use localstorage either. It would come in handy to use localstorage to store the data from the query call. If the database is offline, or if the internetspeed of the user isn't very fast, the localstorage could display the data.

## 8. Mouse / trackpad
Before I adapted the site, it was not possible to navigate through the website without using a mouse or trackpad. After I adapted the website, it is really easy to navigate to sports and persons. It even shows a message if it noticed you pressed tab.

## Conclusion
I didn't expect too much from the results. I knew the web app wasn't finished yet, and thus some exercises would not give very interesting points. By finishing this assignment I know what points I even more missed. I knew the web app wasn't finished, but now I know that I wasn't even remotely finished.

# Device lab
To test my web app, I used the device lab. The device lab is a place where you can test your website on several outdated devices.

## Samsung Galaxy Note 1 (I guess, not sure.)
The website itself did load, but nothing happened. The loading spinner did not rotate, and the query did not load. 

## Nokia something
This one was quite weird. It said that the website had a technical problem, and thus the page could not be loaded. The url was correct, so I had no idea what the problem was.

## LG something
The LG phone was the first one that actually loaded the website as it was supposed to be. It was a bit slow, but it loaded everything just fine. I was quite impressed that my website would actually work one even one phone.

## Kindle
The Kindle thing didn't work. All it said was that there was a problem loading the page.

## Windows tablet
The Windows tablet loaded the page, and the loading spinner spinned like crazy, but nothing after that happened.

## Screenreader
I never used a screenreader before, so it was a big eye opener how hard it was to use a screenreader. Maybe if you are used to it, it becomes easier, but for me it was really hard to use. The website itself was kinda easy to use, but that was maybe because I know how to navigate through my website. What I did like, was that the screenreader reads the current window that has focus. Something that I hated was the fact that the screenreader doesn't know the difference between languages, and it just reads out in the language you filled in. If you have your pc in Dutch, but you are writing something in English (like I am now), it doesn't make sense, and the sentences come out really weird.

# Conclusion
I don't really know what to think of the results. Some of these devices are really outdated, and I highly doubt that any of my possible users are using one of these devices. Something to keep in mind though is that not every thing works like you would expect. Even when it works on my pc,doesn't necessarily mean that it works for everyone everywhere.
